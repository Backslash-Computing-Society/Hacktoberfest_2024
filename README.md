Hacktoberfest 2024


# Contribution Rules📚:

- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
- Do NOT add any build steps, e.g., npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly, or stupid, big or small, as long as it works
<!-- - Add your name to the contributorsList file. -->
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts

## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}
Name your project as Your_Name_Project_Name and tag one of the issues that we have created.

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```terminal
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2024
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing:

```terminal
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo, simply run:

```terminal
git merge upstream/master
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
